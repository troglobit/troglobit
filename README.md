## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Finit](/troglobit/finit)
- 🌱 I’m currently (re)learning how to be a consultant again, after having been at a product company for 15+ years! This means I'm available for contrating though my employer 😎
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on [pim6sd](/troglobit/pim6sd)
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with [In-a-dyn](/troglobit/inadyn), because it supports so many DDNS providers ...
- 💬 Ask me about #multicast 🤓
- 📫 How to reach me: through my employer, or patiently wait for me to read my email (sorry)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I usually say I never travel anywhere (expensive + environment), but my code does.  I recently got word [SMCRoute](/troglobit/smcroute) was used on the south pole! 😅
