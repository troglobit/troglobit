## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± Once upon a time, when I still was a young and promising engineer, I made many mistakes.  This remains today the best way to learn stuff and *become experienced*.  If you don't believe me, see my [resumÃ© here](https://resume.troglobit.com/).  It doesn't tell the whole story, but it's representative enough.

After a scary wakup call I'm now scaling back my involvement in both social media and most of my Open Source projects.  In short, had it not been for an immigrant doctor, I'd been dead.  I've not had time to archive all my low-priority projects yet, so please bear with me.  I'm still alive, but these days I focus on what's left of my family and friends, rather than waste away thanklessly helping people use old software I once wrote.

Sorry to be blunt, but just because the software I publish here is free/open, I don't owe you support or free services (installation/troubleshooting/provisioning).  There seems to be some misconception here around all that, so I just want to make it clear.  There are lots of companies around that can help you with that, if you don't want to spend the time reading up and learning about $TOPIC.

- ðŸ“« For paid/consultancy work, reach me through my employer, [Addiva Elektronik](https://www.addiva.se/electronics/), talk to [Lennart](https://www.addiva.se/contact/)
- ðŸ”­ The projects I enjoy most working on are [Finit](https://github.com/troglobit/finit) and [Infix](https://github.com/kernelkit/infix), check out the latest releases of Finit, including [blog posts](https://troglobit.com/tags/init/)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to find collaborators on:
  - [libnet](https://github.com/libnet/libnet)
  - [libConfuse](https://github.com/libConfuse/libConfuse)
  - [pim6sd](https://github.com/troglobit/pim6sd) and [pimd](https://github.com/troglobit/pimd), because my spare time is not enough.  Without external involvement, these projects will be archived soon.
  - [In-a-dyn](https://github.com/troglobit/inadyn), because it supports so many [DDNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_DNS) providers


ðŸ’¬ People used to call me #MrMulticast, and sometimes I could help them.  I used to maintain many #multicast daemons for UNIX.  Some of which I may be interested in shepherding a while longer: [SMCRoute](https://github.com/troglobit/smcroute), [mrouted](https://github.com/troglobit/mrouted), abd [pimd-dense](https://github.com/troglobit/pimd-dense).  
ðŸ’¬ I've also made a few useful testing tools, for example [mcjoin](https://github.com/troglobit/mcjoin), [mping](https://github.com/troglobit/mping), [mtools](https://github.com/troglobit/mtools)

> âš¡ Fun fact: [SMCRoute](https://github.com/troglobit/smcroute) handles readout packets for the South Pole Telescope in Antarctica! ðŸ˜Ž
