## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on [Finit](/troglobit/finit), check out the latest releases and [log posts](https://troglobit.com/tags/init/)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on [pim6sd](/troglobit/pim6sd) and ðŸ¤” help with [In-a-dyn](/troglobit/inadyn), because it supports so many DDNS providers ...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about #multicast ðŸ¤“ I maintain many #multicast daemons for UNIX: SMCRoute, pimd, mrouted, pimd-dense, and pimg6sd.  I've also made a few useful testing tools, for example [mcjoin](/troglobit/mcjoin) and [mping](/troglobit/mping)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I usually say I never travel anywhere (expensive + environment), but my code does.  I recently got word [SMCRoute](/troglobit/smcroute) was used on the south pole! ðŸ˜…

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: through my employer, [Addiva Elektronik](https://www.addiva.se/addiva-elektronik/), or patiently wait for me to read my email (sorry)
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m (re)learning how to be a consultant again, after having been at a product company for 15+ years! This means I'm available for contracting though my employer ðŸ˜Ž
