## Hi there, I'm Joachim ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m (re)learning how to be a consultant again, having been at a product company for 15+ years!  
This means I'm now available for contracting though my employer ðŸ˜Ž
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: through my employer, [Addiva Elektronik](https://www.addiva.se/electronics/), talk to [Lennart](https://www.addiva.se/contact/).  Or patiently wait for me to read my email -- sorry, paying customers and sponsors (!) take precedence.

I've also made a few useful testing tools, for example [mcjoin](https://github.com/troglobit/mcjoin) and [mping](https://github.com/troglobit/mping)

> âš¡ Fun fact: I rarely travel (expensive + environment), but my code does.
>    A while back I learnedthat [SMCRoute](https://github.com/troglobit/smcroute) handles readout packets for the South Pole Telescope in Antarctica! ðŸ˜…
